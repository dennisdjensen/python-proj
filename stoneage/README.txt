stoneage project:
-----------------

The goal ist to develop an AI (robot) that can play the boardgame 'Stoneage':
http://www.yucata.de/en/Rules/StoneAge

In the end we hope to have an AI implementation, where you can program and try
out different playing-strategies (Strategy Pattern?).

Project Guidelines:
---------------------
                                                                              
- The implementation is in Python 3 (we want to learn Python 3).

- The implementation is Object-Oriented.

- Unit-test for all classes is a must.

- A bug is just a unit-test you haven't written yet.

 - We will at some point implement a simple game-loop running some sort of
   text-based console UI. In short: a full-blown UI implementation is not a
   primary goal.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to have some kind of milestones, this is a proposal for some 
sequential implementation stages:

Stage 1:
-----------------
1) One AI player, 

2) The 5 different resource fields (food, wood, clay,stone, gold) but no
   village fields

3) Huts but no cards

4) Exactly 5 persons.

Stage 2:
-----------------
1) Adding a gameloop so one human player can play against the AI from Stage 1

Stage 3:
-----------------
1) Adding the village fields

Stage 4:
-----------------
1) Adding the cards to the game

Stage 5:
-----------------
1) Playing with 4 players
